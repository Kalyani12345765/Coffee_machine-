# Coffee_machine-
A simple functional coffee_machine, in Python 

This project was built as part of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp on Udemy. 
I wrote all the logic, structure, and functions myself, using only the data --> (MENU+ resources) provided in the course.  

# Project Overview
This project allows the user to choose from three drinks. The code checks ingredients availability, processes coins, updates the resources after validating both the coins and ingredients, and returns the appropriate change. Also, "off" and "report" commands were also implemented.
